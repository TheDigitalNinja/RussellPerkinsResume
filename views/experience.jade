			p Systems administration - Linux, Windows Server, AWS, Linode and Puppet. Whether reliability, scalability, cost or all of the above are your main concern I helped  find a solution and implement it that best suits each clients individual needs.
			p Web design and development - Utilize many of the latest technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 (sass or less too), bootstrap and jquery for front end and php and node.js for back end architecture. I am also very familiar with responsive design via bootstrap and facebook's open graph for social interactions. Use the lean startup, A/B testing and rapid prototype methodology to help get a MVP (minimum viable product) out as soon as possible for the lowest cost.
